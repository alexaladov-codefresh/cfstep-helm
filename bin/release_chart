# related to working with Kubectl and Helm.

# The Python script "build_entrypoint_script" will create the true entrypoint script ("/tmp/run")
# based on variables exported in the current environment. If any required vars are missing, or
# there is some invalid combo of vars, this step will fail and message will be printed to stderr.
#
# Finally the "/tmp/run" script is executed (or sourced if this script itself is being sourced)
